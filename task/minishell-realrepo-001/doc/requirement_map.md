## Reference And Model Verification

| Mini-SWE-Agent + DeepSeek Chat | 100.00% | 91.67% | 8.33 | code_agent_candidate_reviewed | `score_report_mini_swe_agent_deepseek_chat_001_unit_system_v1.json` |

Current status: reference passes, but no executable code-agent run reaches the `gap >= 15pp` core-strong threshold. MiniShell remains task-level `needs_code_agent_gap`; individual executable agent runs with completed reports are marked `candidate_reviewed` in `score_summary.csv`. Plain GPT / DeepSeek / Doubao bare-model runs are excluded from the public score evidence.

## Fairness Notes

- The public packet intentionally excludes full Bash compatibility, job control, wildcard expansion, subshells, heredocs, and compound shell operators.
- Tests focus on observable stdout, file contents, working directory state, environment state, and exit status behavior.
- Exact error text is not treated as public API unless a test checks only stable observable recovery behavior.

## Strengthening Pass 2026-06-21

Additional cases were added after comparing this task with the official core examples in `Bmk-dev`:

- `MSU015` checks syntax-error recovery through public stdin behavior rather than private parser internals.
- `MSU016` checks `grep` miss status propagation into later `$?` expansion.
- `MSS012` checks the boundary between pipeline dataflow and per-command input redirection.

This brings MiniShell to 16 unit cases and 12 system cases, matching the scale used by stronger official tasks while keeping setup entirely public and reproducible.
