## Reference And Model Verification

| Reference | 100.00% | 100.00% | 0.00 | reference_pass | `score_report_reference_unit_system_v1.json` |
| Codex subagent | 100.00% | 93.75% | 6.25 | code_agent_candidate_reviewed | `score_report_codex_subagent_001_unit_system_v1.json` |

Current status: reference passes, and multiple executable code-agent runs show positive gaps, but the maximum code-agent gap is currently 12.50pp. MiniBuildGraph remains `needs_code_agent_gap` until an executable code-agent run reaches the `gap >= 15pp` core-strong threshold.

## Fairness Notes

- The benchmark does not require AOSP, Soong evaluation, repo, git, Docker, network access, or a full Android checkout.
- Module files use a deliberately small block format instead of full Android Blueprint syntax.
- Load parse errors are checked by stable `ERR` shape and graph-preservation behavior, not by exact wording.
- Query outputs are line-oriented and deterministic, usually lexicographic by module name.

## Strengthening Pass 2026-06-21

Additional cases were added after comparing this task with the official core examples in `Bmk-dev`:

- `MBGU013` checks the acyclic branch of cycle detection.
- `MBGU014` checks forward references inside one loaded graph.
- `MBGU015` checks that removal drops outgoing edges from the removed module.
- `MBGU016` checks malformed dependency-list rejection.
- `MBGS011` checks unresolved dependencies across transitive and reverse-transitive queries.
- `MBGS012` checks duplicate-load error atomicity against a previous valid graph.

This brings MiniBuildGraph to 16 unit cases and 16 system cases, matching the scale used by stronger official tasks while keeping all state setup through public `LOAD` commands.

## Model-Gap Strengthening Pass 2026-06-21

After reviewing earlier non-public exploratory outputs, MiniBuildGraph was strengthened with additional public-behavior system cases:

- `MBGS013` checks that a trailing dependency comma fails atomically and preserves later `INFO` behavior.
- `MBGS014` checks that an empty file cannot silently replace a valid graph.
- `MBGS015` checks that top-level garbage fails without clearing unresolved dependency state.
- `MBGS016` checks that malformed reloads after `REMOVE` preserve the already-mutated graph state.

These cases exercise the public `LOAD` failure rules and the invariant that failed `LOAD` operations must preserve the previous graph unchanged. They use only public `LOAD`, query, and `REMOVE` commands and do not depend on private reference file formats.

Plain GPT / DeepSeek / Doubao bare-model runs are excluded from the public score evidence; only executable code-agent reports are retained.
